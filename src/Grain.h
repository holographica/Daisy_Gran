    - phase
      - == current pos within grain waveform - from 0 to sample length
      - determines which part of sample is played 
      - relative position within grain 
    
    - phase increment
      - this is calculated based on pitch as well as sample rate + other factors
      - (basically how fast we move thru buffer when playing the grain)

      - amount phase is increased at each step of processing
        - ie every audio sample == data point - 1 sample is 1/48000 secs at 48kHz
      - ie controls speed + pitch of grain
      - large inc == faster speed so higher pitch
        - eg if phase inc==1.0: phase moves 1 sample position each processing step
        - if ==0.5, every sample/data point is read twice
          - this means overalll audio file is played at half speed -> pitch is 1 octave lower
        - if ==2, every other data point is skipped -> 2x speed -> 1octave higher

        - roughly (check this): phase increment = (source_sample_rate / output_sample_rate) * 2^(pitch_shift_in_semitones/12)
        - use source+output SRs if we allow playback at diff rate than original sample
        - ie if file is 48khz, output is 44.1
        - depends if i convert files to a set SR or not 
        - helps with flexibility in regards to input/output devices

    - (amplitude) envelope
      - ie ADSR 
      - helps avoid clicks/pops by smoothing playback start/stop 
      - shapes the sound of the grain
      - represented as a single float value == an amplitude multiplier
        - this is calculated using ADSR values, curve shapes, etc

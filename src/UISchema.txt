UISchema

State Selection:
- State::Startup: led1 = flashing / pulsing white
- State::SelectFile: led1 = flashing / pulsing blue
- State::PlayWAV: led1 = flashing / pulsing cyan
- State::Synthesis: led1 = flashing / pulsing green while synth loads then fades out
- State::Error: led1 = flashing/solid red 

Synth Mode Selection:
- Mode::SizePosition: led1 = solid green, led2 = solid (or pulsing?) green
    - Mode::SizePositionRnd: led 2 = red (solid? or pulsing)
- Mode::PitchActiveGrains: led1 = solid yellow, led2 = solid (or pulsing?) green
    - Mode::PitchActiveGrainsRnd: led 2 = red (solid? or pulsing)
- Mode::PanPanRnd: led1 = solid blue, led2 = solid (or pulsing?) green
- Mode::PhasorEnv: led1 = solid purple, led2 = solid (or pulsing?) green
    - Mode::PhasorEnvRnd: led 2 = red (solid? or pulsing)



    stuff to update:
    UIManager:
    - UpdateState
    - UpdateSynthMode
    - BlinkLed (or make a pulse function?)

    - change functions like GranularSynth::InitSynth to return bool
      so we can set state to error if they break
    - start audiocallback when file selected
    - implement playwav mode in between select file and synthesis
    - 

TODO TODAY:

- add more pages for the synth parameters and hook them up
  - env type, phasor type, pan, spray, randomness for grain size/spawn pos/etc

- add granular app

- add chord mode 

- start mocking framework for tests???
